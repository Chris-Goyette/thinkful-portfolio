                    <h2>Hi. I'm Chris Goyette!</h2>
                    <p>I am a software developer living in the Bay Area.</p>
                    <p>In my last job I was working in fintech as a Fraud Analyst 
                        for a peer-to-peer lending company.</p>
                    <p>After getting laid off, I realized that I wanted more in life and that 
                        I needed to be more valuable to society. That's when I decided that I wanted 
                        to level up my skills and become a software developer.</p>

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Getting laid off during the novel Covid-19 pandemic has been a real wake up call to me. 
                        Working in Operations made me quickly realize just how vulnerable my job was.</p>
                    <p>My professional background is in credit underwriting and fraud analysis. 
                        As much as I enjoyed my profession, I realized that I needed to learn more technical skills 
                        if I want to stay competitive in the workforce.</p>
                    <p>I have always been fascinated with technology and all the things you can create with it. 
                        The reason why I chose to pursue web development and software engineering is because 
                        I want to be able to create and build those things myself. I feel that I have a lot to 
                        contribute to the world and I want to do my part.</p>
